  storyText: 'Fasters. EveryWhere. Armed mostly with gas-powered rock flingers.

    At least 10 of them guarding the hangar door. Typical.


    Could try punching my way through. Or sneaking the long way to the emergency exit.


    What should I do?

    1. Take them head on -rush the 10 guards.

    2. Sneak my way to the emergency exit.'
